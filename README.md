# Conversation starters

This repo contains some code that helps a trainer, who delivers a Microsoft Official Training (for example AZ-2005, SC-100, ...), to have a set of conversation starters available for each Microsoft Learn Module. 

The idea is to have the following resources ready to be used during the delivery of a Learn Module:

- 5 Open ended questions that help learners become interested in the course.
- A mindmap of all topics covered.
- A practice assesment of up to 10 questions. 
- Complex Problem for Group Discussion

Check the output folder in this repo for some examples.

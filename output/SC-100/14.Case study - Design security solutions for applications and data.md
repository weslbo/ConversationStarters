### Complex Problem for Group Discussion

**Problem:**

Contoso is planning to transition its entire on-premises infrastructure to Microsoft Azure and fully embrace cloud-based DevSecOps practices. However, the development and operations teams have conflicting priorities, and the InfoSec team frequently identifies vulnerabilities in both the code and infrastructure. The CIO has laid out a plan that includes replacing current processes with automated CI/CD workflows and addressing security concerns. Despite the existing Azure DevOps Server installation, the decision was made to choose GitHub as the target platform for implementing the plan.

**Discussion Points:**

1. **Conflict Resolution:** How can Contoso's development and operations teams align their priorities to work cohesively in a cloud-based DevSecOps environment?
2. **Security Integration:** What steps should Contoso take to integrate security practices into their CI/CD workflows effectively?
3. **Tool Selection:** Given the decision to use GitHub, which specific GitHub features and Azure services should Contoso leverage to meet their design requirements?
4. **Risk Mitigation:** How can Contoso minimize the risk of unauthorized access to their CI/CD workflows and protect sensitive information?
5. **Compliance and Validation:** What strategies can Contoso implement to ensure that applications deployed into the staging environment comply with security standards before moving to production?

Encourage the group to discuss these points and come up with a comprehensive plan that addresses the challenges and meets the design requirements laid out by the CIO.

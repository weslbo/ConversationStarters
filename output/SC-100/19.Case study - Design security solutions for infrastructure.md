### Complex Problem

**Problem Statement:**

Contoso is planning to migrate its on-premises VDI environment to Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) to enhance security and reduce operational overhead. However, the company is concerned about the potential security risks during the migration process and the initial setup of AVD. Your task is to design a comprehensive security strategy for this migration. Consider the following aspects:

1. How will you ensure the security of data during the migration process?
2. What steps will you take to secure the Azure Virtual Desktop environment once it is set up?
3. How will you integrate Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel into the new AVD environment?
4. What measures will you implement to secure remote access for employees using AVD?
5. How will you address any potential vulnerabilities in the new AVD setup?

**Group Discussion Points:**

- Discuss the potential risks and challenges during the migration process.
- Explore the best practices for securing data in transit and at rest.
- Identify the key security features of Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel that can be leveraged.
- Consider the role of Microsoft Intune in managing and securing remote devices.
- Develop a phased implementation plan to ensure a smooth and secure transition to Azure Virtual Desktop.

This complex problem encourages learners to think critically about the migration process, consider various security aspects, and collaborate to develop a comprehensive solution.

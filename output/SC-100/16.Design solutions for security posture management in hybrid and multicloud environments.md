### Complex Problem

**Scenario:**

Your organization is planning to adopt a hybrid and multicloud strategy to enhance its flexibility and scalability. The IT team is tasked with ensuring that the security posture of the entire infrastructure, including on-premises, Azure, AWS, and GCP environments, is robust and compliant with industry standards. 

**Problem:**

Design a comprehensive security posture management solution that integrates Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Azure Arc to manage and protect the hybrid and multicloud environment. Your solution should address the following:

1. How to onboard and manage non-Azure resources using Azure Arc.
2. How to use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to continuously assess and improve the security posture.
3. How to implement attack path analysis and cloud security explorer to identify and mitigate potential risks.
4. How to ensure compliance with regulatory standards across all environments.
5. How to manage and protect workloads, including servers, applications, and databases, in the hybrid and multicloud environment.

**Discussion Points:**

- What are the key steps to onboard non-Azure resources using Azure Arc?
- How can Microsoft Defender for Cloud's secure score be used to prioritize security improvements?
- What are the benefits of using attack path analysis in a multicloud environment?
- How can regulatory compliance be maintained across different cloud providers?
- What are the best practices for protecting workloads in a hybrid and multicloud environment?

Encourage the group to discuss and collaborate on creating a detailed plan that addresses each of these points, considering the unique challenges and benefits of a hybrid and multicloud strategy.

### Complex Problem for Group Discussion

**Scenario:**

Your organization is planning to migrate its on-premises infrastructure to Azure. The infrastructure includes multiple applications that need to be securely segmented and monitored. The applications are divided into three main categories: web applications, database applications, and internal tools. The organization also needs to ensure that all traffic is filtered and monitored for security threats. Additionally, remote employees need secure access to internal resources without using a traditional VPN.

**Tasks:**

1. Design a network segmentation strategy using Azure features to isolate the three categories of applications.
2. Propose a solution for filtering traffic between these segments and with external networks.
3. Recommend tools and methods for monitoring network traffic and detecting security threats.
4. Suggest a solution for providing secure access to internal resources for remote employees.

**Discussion Points:**

- What Azure features will you use for network segmentation and why?
- How will you configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Application Security Groups (ASGs) to control traffic?
- What role will Azure Firewall play in your design?
- How will you use Microsoft Defender for DNS and Traffic Analytics to monitor and secure the network?
- What are the benefits and potential challenges of using Microsoft Entra Private Access for remote access?

Encourage the group to discuss and come up with a comprehensive solution that addresses all aspects of the scenario.

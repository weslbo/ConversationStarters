### Complex Problem for Group Discussion

**Problem:**

Your organization is planning to migrate its on-premises Active Directory infrastructure to a hybrid cloud environment using Azure. The goal is to ensure seamless integration of on-premises and cloud resources while maintaining high security standards. The organization also wants to enable external partners to access certain resources securely and implement modern authentication strategies to enhance user experience and security.

**Tasks:**

1. Design a comprehensive identity and access management strategy that includes:
   - Integration of on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft Entra ID.
   - Secure access for external partners using B2B collaboration.
   - Implementation of Conditional Access policies to protect sensitive resources.
   - Use of Continuous Access Evaluation to ensure real-time policy enforcement.

2. Outline the steps to harden the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to prevent potential security breaches.

3. Develop a plan for managing secrets, keys, and certificates using Azure Key Vault, ensuring compliance with best practices.

**Discussion Points:**

- What are the key challenges in integrating on-premises AD with Microsoft Entra ID, and how can they be addressed?
- How can Conditional Access policies be tailored to meet the specific needs of your organization?
- What are the best practices for managing external identities and ensuring secure collaboration with partners?
- How can the organization ensure the security of its secrets, keys, and certificates in a hybrid cloud environment?

Encourage the group to brainstorm and come up with a detailed plan addressing each of these tasks and discussion points.

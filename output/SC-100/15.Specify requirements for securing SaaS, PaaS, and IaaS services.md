### Complex Problem

**Scenario:**

Your organization is planning to deploy a new web application that will handle sensitive customer data. The application will be hosted on Azure App Service and will use Azure SQL Database for data storage. The application must comply with strict security regulations, including data encryption, access control, and regular security assessments.

**Problem Statement:**

As a group, discuss and develop a comprehensive security strategy for this web application. Your strategy should address the following aspects:

1. **Network Security:** How will you ensure secure network communication between the web application and the database? What measures will you take to protect against DDoS attacks?
2. **Identity and Access Management:** How will you manage user authentication and authorization? What role will Microsoft Entra ID play in your strategy?
3. **Data Protection:** How will you ensure that sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest? What key management practices will you implement?
4. **Monitoring and Logging:** What tools and practices will you use to monitor the application's security posture and detect potential threats?
5. **Regular Security Assessments:** How will you incorporate regular security assessments, such as penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, into your security strategy?

**Expected Outcome:**

The group should come up with a detailed security plan that includes specific Azure services and best practices for each aspect of the security strategy. The plan should also outline a schedule for regular security assessments and a process for responding to security incidents.

### Complex Problem

**Scenario:**

Your organization is planning to migrate its on-premises data storage and databases to Azure. The data includes sensitive customer information, financial records, and intellectual property. You need to design a comprehensive data security strategy that ensures the protection of data at rest, data in transit, and data in use. Additionally, you must ensure compliance with industry regulations and provide robust threat detection and response capabilities.

**Problem Statement:**

Design a data security solution for your organization's Azure workloads. Your solution should include:

1. **Data Classification and Discovery:** How will you classify and discover sensitive data across your Azure environment?
2. **Encryption:** What encryption methods will you use for data at rest and data in transit? How will you manage encryption keys?
3. **Access Management:** How will you control access to your data and ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information?
4. **Threat Detection and Response:** How will you implement threat detection and response mechanisms to protect against potential attacks?
5. **Compliance:** How will you ensure that your data security strategy complies with industry regulations and standards?

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss the role of Microsoft Purview in data classification and discovery.
- Explore the use of Azure Key Vault for managing encryption keys.
- Evaluate the benefits of using Microsoft Defender for SQL and Microsoft Defender for Storage.
- Consider the implementation of network security measures such as VPNs and firewalls.
- Discuss how to enforce multi-factor authentication and role-based access control.

Encourage the group to collaborate and come up with a detailed plan that addresses each aspect of the problem statement.

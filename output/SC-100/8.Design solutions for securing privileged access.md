### Complex Problem

**Scenario:**

Your organization is transitioning from a legacy AD tier model to the enterprise access model. The IT team is tasked with designing a secure privileged access strategy that includes the following components:

1. Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for just-in-time access.
2. Privileged Access Management (PAM) for granular task-level control.
3. Secure workstations for administrators.
4. Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) for managing permissions across multi-cloud environments.

**Problem Statement:**

Design a comprehensive privileged access strategy that addresses the following:

1. How will you integrate PIM and PAM to ensure both role-level and task-level security?
2. What steps will you take to transition from the legacy AD tier model to the enterprise access model?
3. How will you ensure that secure workstations are effectively deployed and managed?
4. What measures will you implement to continuously monitor and remediate permissions in a multi-cloud environment?

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss the challenges and solutions for integrating PIM and PAM.
- Outline a step-by-step plan for transitioning from the legacy AD tier model.
- Identify the key security controls and policies for deploying secure workstations.
- Explore the tools and techniques for effective CIEM implementation.

This problem encourages group discussions and collaborative problem-solving, allowing learners to apply their knowledge to a real-world scenario.

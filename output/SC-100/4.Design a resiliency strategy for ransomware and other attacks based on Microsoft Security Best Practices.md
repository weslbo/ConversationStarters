### Complex Problem for Group Discussion

**Scenario:**

Your company, a medium-sized enterprise, has recently experienced a ransomware attack that encrypted critical business data and disrupted operations. The attack was traced back to a phishing email that an employee inadvertently opened. The company had some backup systems in place, but they were not comprehensive, and the recovery process has been slow and incomplete. 

**Problem:**

As a team of cybersecurity architects, you are tasked with designing a comprehensive backup and restore plan to prevent such incidents in the future and ensure quick recovery. Your plan should include:

1. **Identification of Critical Systems:** Determine which systems and data are most critical to the business and prioritize them for backup.
2. **Backup Strategy:** Develop a secure backup strategy using Azure Backup, ensuring that backups are protected from tampering and can be quickly restored.
3. **Security Update Management:** Propose a plan for managing security updates across all systems to prevent vulnerabilities.
4. **Business Resiliency Measures:** Outline steps to ensure business operations can continue during an attack, even if they are degraded.
5. **Employee Training:** Suggest a training program to educate employees about phishing and other social engineering attacks.

**Discussion Points:**

- How will you identify and prioritize critical systems and data?
- What specific features of Azure Backup will you leverage to secure backups?
- How will you ensure that security updates are applied consistently across all systems?
- What measures will you put in place to maintain business operations during an attack?
- What key elements should be included in the employee training program to prevent phishing attacks?

Encourage the group to discuss these points and come up with a detailed plan that addresses each aspect of the problem.

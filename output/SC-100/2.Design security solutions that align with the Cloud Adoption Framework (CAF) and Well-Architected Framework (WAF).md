### Complex Problem for Group Discussion

**Problem Statement:**

Your organization is planning to migrate its entire IT infrastructure to the cloud. The current on-premises setup includes a mix of legacy applications, modern web services, and a variety of data storage solutions. The security team is concerned about maintaining a high level of security during and after the migration. They are particularly worried about:

1. Ensuring that all data remains confidential and is not exposed during the migration.
2. Maintaining the integrity of applications and data.
3. Ensuring availability and minimizing downtime during the transition.
4. Adopting a zero-trust security model to protect against potential breaches.

**Discussion Points:**

1. How would you leverage the Cloud Adoption Framework to plan and execute this migration?
2. What steps would you take to modernize the security strategy to align with cloud-native capabilities?
3. How can Azure Landing Zones be utilized to create a secure and scalable environment for both legacy and modern applications?
4. What specific measures would you implement to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability during the migration?
5. How would you integrate the principles of the Well-Architected Framework, particularly the security pillar, into your overall cloud strategy?

Encourage the group to discuss these points and come up with a comprehensive migration and security plan that addresses all the concerns.

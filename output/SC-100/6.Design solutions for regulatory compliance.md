You are responsible for ensuring that the organization complies with various regulatory standards, including HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR. The organization is in the process of migrating its IT infrastructure to Azure and needs to ensure that all compliance requirements are met during and after the migration.

**Problem:**

Design a comprehensive compliance strategy that addresses the following:

1. How will you translate the compliance requirements of HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR into actionable security controls in Azure?
2. What steps will you take to ensure that the organization's cloud governance policies are aligned with these compliance requirements?
3. How will you use Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Priva to manage and monitor compliance?
4. What measures will you implement to continuously evaluate and remediate non-compliant resources using Azure Policy and Microsoft Defender for Cloud?
5. How will you handle data subject requests and ensure data privacy across different regions?

**Discussion Points:**

- Identify the specific compliance requirements for HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.
- Discuss the role of Azure Policy in enforcing compliance.
- Explore how Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager can be used to track and manage compliance activities.
- Evaluate the use of Microsoft Priva for handling data privacy and subject rights requests.

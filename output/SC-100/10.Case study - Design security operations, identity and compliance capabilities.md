### Complex Problem for Group Discussion

**Problem:**

Contoso is planning to provide secure access to its internal web applications for both its remote employees and external partners from Fabrikam. The internal applications rely on Kerberos authentication and are hosted on-premises. Contoso wants to ensure that access is tightly controlled, monitored, and compliant with their security policies. They also want to minimize the use of passwords and ensure that any access is granted based on the state of the user's device and other contextual factors.

**Discussion Points:**

1. How would you design a solution that integrates Microsoft Entra ID with Contoso's on-premises AD DS to meet these requirements?
2. What specific Microsoft Entra services and features would you leverage to provide secure access to the internal web applications?
3. How would you ensure that the solution adheres to Zero Trust principles, such as verify explicitly, use least privilege access, and assume breach?
4. What steps would you take to minimize the use of passwords and implement more secure authentication methods?
5. How would you configure Conditional Access policies to control access based on the user's device compliance state and other contextual factors?
6. What mechanisms would you put in place to monitor and audit access to the internal applications, ensuring compliance with security policies?

Encourage the group to discuss and propose a comprehensive solution, considering all aspects of the problem and leveraging the capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID and related services.

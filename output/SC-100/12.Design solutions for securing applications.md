### Complex Problem for Group Discussion

**Problem:**

Your organization is planning to deploy a new web application that will handle sensitive customer data and integrate with multiple third-party services. The application will be hosted on Azure and will use a microservices architecture. The development team is using a CI/CD pipeline to ensure rapid deployment and updates.

**Tasks:**

1. **Threat Modeling:** Conduct a threat modeling session to identify potential threats to the application. Use the STRIDE model to categorize the threats.
2. **Security Integration:** Propose a strategy to integrate security practices into the CI/CD pipeline. Consider both static and dynamic application security testing.
3. **API Management:** Design a solution for managing and securing the APIs used by the application. Include considerations for API gateway, rate limiting, and authentication.
4. **Workload Identity:** Develop a plan for managing workload identities to ensure secure access to Azure resources. Discuss the use of managed identities and Conditional Access policies.
5. **Monitoring and Response:** Outline a monitoring and incident response plan to detect and respond to security incidents. Include the use of Azure Monitor, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and logging practices.

**Discussion Points:**

- What are the key threats identified in the threat modeling session, and how can they be mitigated?
- How can security be seamlessly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline without slowing down the development process?
- What are the best practices for securing APIs in a microservices architecture?
- How can workload identities be managed effectively to minimize security risks?
- What tools and practices should be used for monitoring and responding to security incidents in real-time?

This complex problem encourages learners to apply the concepts covered in the course to a real-world scenario, fostering collaboration and critical thinking.

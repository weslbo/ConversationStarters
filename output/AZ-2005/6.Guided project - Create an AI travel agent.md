### Complex Problem

**Scenario:**

Margie's Travel wants to expand the capabilities of TravelBot to include real-time flight status updates and notifications for customers. This feature should allow users to ask TravelBot about the status of their flights, and TravelBot should be able to provide real-time updates and send notifications if there are any changes to the flight schedule.

**Problem Statement:**

As a group, discuss and outline a plan to integrate this new feature into TravelBot. Consider the following aspects:

1. **Data Integration:** How will you integrate real-time flight status data into TravelBot? What APIs or data sources will you use?
2. **User Interaction:** How will users interact with TravelBot to get flight status updates? What kind of prompts and responses will be necessary?
3. **Notifications:** How will TravelBot handle notifications for flight status changes? What mechanisms will you use to send notifications to users?
4. **Error Handling:** How will you handle potential errors or issues, such as unavailable data or API failures?
5. **Testing:** What strategies will you use to test this new feature to ensure it works correctly and reliably?

**Expected Outcome:**

The group should come up with a detailed plan that addresses each of the aspects mentioned above. The plan should include specific technologies, APIs, and methods to be used, as well as a strategy for testing and error handling. This discussion will help you understand the complexities involved in integrating new features into an AI chatbot and prepare you for real-world development challenges.

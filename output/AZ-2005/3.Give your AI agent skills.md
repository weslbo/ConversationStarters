### Complex Problem

**Scenario:**

You are tasked with developing a smart home assistant using the Semantic Kernel SDK. The assistant should be able to control various smart devices such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras. Additionally, it should provide personalized recommendations for energy-saving tips based on the user's habits.

**Problem:**

1. Design a set of native functions that can interact with different smart devices (e.g., turn lights on/off, adjust thermostat settings, and monitor security cameras).
2. Create a plugin structure to organize these native functions effectively.
3. Develop a semantic prompt that uses these native functions to provide personalized energy-saving tips.

**Discussion Points:**

- How would you structure your code to ensure scalability and maintainability?
- What parameters and decorators would you use for each native function?
- How would you handle user authentication and data privacy in your smart home assistant?
- What challenges might arise when integrating these native functions with the Semantic Kernel SDK, and how would you address them?

Encourage the group to brainstorm and come up with a detailed plan, including code snippets and architectural diagrams, to solve this complex problem.

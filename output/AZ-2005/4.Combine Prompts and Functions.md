### Complex Problem for Group Discussion

**Problem:**

You are tasked with developing an intelligent personal assistant using the Semantic Kernel SDK. The assistant should be able to manage a user's daily schedule, provide personalized recommendations for leisure activities, and summarize lengthy emails. 

1. **Design the architecture** of your assistant, detailing how you will integrate functions within prompts to handle these tasks.
2. **Identify the plugins** you will need to load into the kernel and explain their roles.
3. **Create a sample prompt** that uses nested functions to summarize an email and provide a recommendation for a leisure activity based on the user's preferences.
4. **Discuss potential challenges** you might face in implementing this solution and propose strategies to overcome them.

This problem encourages learners to apply their knowledge practically and think critically about the integration of functions within prompts to create a robust AI application.

# Complex Problem

**Scenario:**  
You are a data engineer at a global retail company. Your task is to create a unified semantic model using Dataflows Gen2 to consolidate sales data from various international stores. The data sources include SQL databases, Excel files, and cloud storage. The business requires real-time analytics and reporting capabilities.

**Problem:**  
Design a solution using Dataflows Gen2 and Data Pipelines in Microsoft Fabric to achieve the following objectives:

1. Extract data from multiple sources and transform it into a consistent format.
2. Ensure data quality and consistency across all stores.
3. Provide a semantic model that can be easily accessed by data analysts for reporting.
4. Optimize the process to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
5. Discuss potential challenges and how you would address them.

**Discussion Points:**

- How would you structure the Dataflows Gen2 to handle different data sources?
- What transformations would you apply to ensure data consistency?
- How would you integrate Dataflows Gen2 with Data Pipelines for real-time analytics?
- What strategies would you use to optimize performance and handle large data volumes?
- Identify potential challenges and propose solutions to overcome them.

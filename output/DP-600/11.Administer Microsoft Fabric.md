**Scenario:**  
Your organization is planning to implement Microsoft Fabric to enhance its data analytics capabilities. As a Fabric admin, you are tasked with ensuring that the platform is set up to meet the organization's security and governance requirements. You need to:

- Design a strategy for managing user access and licenses.
- Implement data governance policies, including content endorsement and metadata scanning.
- Ensure that the platform is optimized for performance and scalability.

**Discussion Points:**

1. How would you structure the tenant, capacities, and domains to align with the organization's departments?
2. What steps would you take to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data?
3. How would you use the admin tools to monitor and optimize the platform's performance?
4. What processes would you put in place for content endorsement and certification?
5. How would you handle the integration of on-premises data sources with Fabric?

Encourage group discussions to explore different strategies and solutions for each point.

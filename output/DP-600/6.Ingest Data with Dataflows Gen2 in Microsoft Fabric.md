# Complex Problem

**Scenario:**  
You are a data engineer at a multinational retail company. Your task is to create a unified semantic model that consolidates sales data from various global stores. The data comes from different sources, including cloud databases, on-premises systems, and Excel files. You need to ensure data consistency, optimize performance, and provide easy access for data analysts.

**Problem:**  
Design a data ingestion and transformation strategy using Dataflows Gen2 and Data Pipelines in Microsoft Fabric. Consider the following:

- How will you connect to and extract data from the various sources?
- What transformations will you apply to ensure data consistency and quality?
- How will you optimize the performance of data refreshes?
- How will you integrate Dataflows Gen2 with Data Pipelines to orchestrate additional operations?
- What challenges might you face, and how will you address them?

# Practice Assessment

1. **Multiple Choice:**  
   What is the primary purpose of a model relationship in Power BI?
   - A) To enforce data integrity
   - B) To propagate filters between tables
   - C) To create visualizations
   - D) To store data

   **Answer:** B) To propagate filters between tables

2. **True/False:**  
   A one-to-one relationship is the most common cardinality type in Power BI models.
   - True
   - False

   **Answer:** False

3. **Fill-in-the-Blanks:**  
   The __________ function in DAX is used to retrieve values from the "one" side of a relationship.  
   (Options: RELATED, USERELATIONSHIP, CROSSFILTER)

   **Answer:** RELATED

4. **Multiple Choice:**  
   Which cardinality type allows both columns to contain duplicate values?
   - A) One-to-Many
   - B) Many-to-One
   - C) One-to-One
   - D) Many-to-Many

   **Answer:** D) Many-to-Many

5. **True/False:**  
   Disconnected tables are intended to propagate filters to other model tables.
   - True
   - False

   **Answer:** False

6. **Fill-in-the-Blanks:**  
   A relationship's __________ direction determines how filters will propagate between tables.  
   (Options: cross filter, cardinality, integrity)

   **Answer:** cross filter

7. **Multiple Choice:**  
   What happens when a data refresh operation loads duplicate values into a "one" side column?
   - A) The model automatically corrects the duplicates
   - B) The entire data refresh will fail
   - C) The duplicates are ignored
   - D) The duplicates are merged

   **Answer:** B) The entire data refresh will fail

8. **True/False:**  
   Bi-directional relationships can impact performance negatively.
   - True
   - False

   **Answer:** True

9. **Fill-in-the-Blanks:**  
   The __________ function in DAX can be used to activate a specific inactive relationship.  
   (Options: RELATED, USERELATIONSHIP, TREATAS)

   **Answer:** USERELATIONSHIP

10. **Multiple Choice:**  
    Which of the following is a performance preference for filter propagation?
    - A) Many-to-many cardinality relationships
    - B) Cross source group relationships
    - C) One-to-many intra source group relationships
    - D) Bi-directional relationships

    **Answer:** C) One-to-many intra source group relationships

# Complex Problem

**Scenario:**  
You are tasked with designing a Power BI model for a retail company. The company has sales data stored in multiple tables: **Products**, **Sales**, **Customers**, and **Regions**. The **Products** table has a one-to-many relationship with the **Sales** table, and the **Customers** table has a one-to-many relationship with the **Sales** table. The **Regions** table is not directly related to any other table.

**Problem:**  
Design a model that allows for efficient querying of sales data by product, customer, and region. Consider the following:

- How would you set up the relationships between these tables?
- What cardinality types would you use?
- How would you handle the **Regions** table to allow for filtering by region?
- Discuss the potential use of DAX functions to enhance the model's capabilities.

# Complex Problem

**Problem:**  
Your organization is planning to implement a data warehouse using Microsoft Fabric. The goal is to integrate data from multiple departments, including sales, marketing, and finance, to provide a unified view for analysis and reporting. The data sources include SQL databases, CSV files, and real-time data streams.

**Tasks:**

1. Design a schema for the data warehouse that accommodates the needs of all departments. Consider using star or snowflake schema designs.
2. Identify the fact and dimension tables needed for this schema.
3. Propose a data ingestion strategy that ensures timely and accurate data updates from all sources.
4. Discuss how you would implement security measures to protect sensitive financial data.
5. Suggest a monitoring plan to ensure the data warehouse operates efficiently and securely.

**Discussion Points:**

- How to balance between normalization and denormalization in the schema design.
- The role of surrogate and alternate keys in maintaining data integrity.
- Strategies for handling real-time data ingestion.
- Best practices for implementing role-based access control and encryption.
- Tools and techniques for monitoring performance and security.

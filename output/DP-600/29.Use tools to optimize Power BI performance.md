# Complex Problem

**Scenario:**  
You are part of a team responsible for optimizing a Power BI report used by the sales department. The report is slow to load, especially when interacting with visuals that display sales data over time. The report uses a large dataset with multiple date/time columns and complex DAX measures.

**Task:**  
As a group, discuss and outline a step-by-step approach to identify and resolve the performance issues in the report. Consider using tools like Performance Analyzer, DAX Studio, and Tabular Editor. Discuss potential changes to the data model, DAX queries, and any best practices that should be implemented.

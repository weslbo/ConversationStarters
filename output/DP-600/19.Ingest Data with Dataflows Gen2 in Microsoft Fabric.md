# Complex Problem

**Scenario:**  
You are a data engineer at a multinational retail company. Your task is to create a unified data model that consolidates sales data from various global stores. Each store uses different systems and formats to store their data. You need to ensure that the data is consistent, cleansed, and ready for analysis by the business intelligence team.

**Problem:**  
Design a data ingestion and transformation strategy using Dataflows Gen2 and Data Pipelines in Microsoft Fabric. Consider the following:

- How will you connect to the various data sources?
- What transformations will you apply to ensure data consistency?
- How will you handle data that needs to be updated regularly?
- How will you integrate Dataflows Gen2 with Data Pipelines for additional operations?
- What challenges might you face, and how will you address them?

Encourage group discussions to explore different approaches and solutions to this problem.

# Complex Problem

**Scenario:**  
Your company is planning to implement a Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse to improve its data analytics capabilities. The company has structured data in existing SQL databases and unstructured data from social media and IoT devices. The goal is to create a unified platform for data storage, transformation, and analysis.

**Problem:**  
Design a strategy to ingest, transform, and analyze both structured and unstructured data using the Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse. Consider the following:

- How will you handle data ingestion from multiple sources?
- What tools and techniques will you use for data transformation?
- How will you ensure data consistency and integrity?
- How will you visualize the data for decision-making?

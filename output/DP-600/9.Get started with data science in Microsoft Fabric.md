# Complex Problem

Imagine you are a data scientist working for a retail company. Your task is to predict the sales of a new product for the next quarter. You have historical sales data, customer demographics, and marketing spend data.

Discuss with your group how you would approach this problem using the data science process. Consider the following:

- How would you define the problem and success criteria?
- What data would you need, and how would you prepare it?
- Which machine learning model would you choose and why?
- How would you track and evaluate your model's performance?
- How would you use Microsoft Fabric to manage this project from start to finish?

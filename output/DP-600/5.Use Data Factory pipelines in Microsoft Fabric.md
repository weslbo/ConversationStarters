# Complex Problem

**Scenario:**  
You are tasked with designing a data pipeline in Microsoft Fabric for a retail company. The company wants to ingest sales data from multiple sources, transform it to calculate daily sales totals, and load it into a data warehouse. The pipeline should be flexible enough to handle different file formats and allow for parameterized folder names for storing intermediate data.

**Discussion Points:**

1. How would you structure the pipeline to handle data ingestion from multiple sources?
2. What activities would you include to transform the data and calculate daily sales totals?
3. How can parameters be used to enhance the flexibility of the pipeline?
4. What considerations should be made for scheduling and monitoring the pipeline runs?
5. How would you ensure data integrity and handle potential errors during the pipeline execution?

Encourage group discussions to explore different approaches and solutions to this problem.

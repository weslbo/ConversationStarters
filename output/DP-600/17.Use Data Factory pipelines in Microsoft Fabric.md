# Complex Problem

**Problem:**  
Imagine you are tasked with designing a data pipeline in Microsoft Fabric for a retail company. The company wants to automate the process of ingesting daily sales data from multiple store locations into a central data warehouse. The data needs to be cleaned and transformed to include only sales above a certain threshold and then aggregated by product category. Additionally, the company wants to be able to adjust the sales threshold dynamically without altering the pipeline structure.

**Discussion Points:**

- How would you structure the pipeline to achieve these requirements?
- What activities would you include in the pipeline, and why?
- How would you use parameters to allow dynamic adjustment of the sales threshold?
- What challenges might you face in implementing this pipeline, and how would you address them?

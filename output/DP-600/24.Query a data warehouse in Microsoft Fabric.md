# Complex Problem

**Problem:**

Imagine you are part of a team tasked with setting up a data warehouse for an online retail company using Microsoft Fabric. The company wants to analyze sales data to improve their marketing strategies and inventory management. 

Your team needs to design a star schema for the data warehouse. Consider the following:

- The company sells products in multiple categories and regions.
- They want to track sales data, including the number of units sold, sales revenue, and discounts.
- They need to analyze customer demographics, such as age, gender, and location.
- The company wants to understand sales trends over time, including daily, monthly, and yearly trends.

**Discussion Points:**

1. How would you design the star schema for this data warehouse? Identify the fact and dimension tables you would create.
2. What types of queries would you run to extract insights for marketing strategies?
3. How would you use the SQL query editor and visual query editor to facilitate these tasks?
4. Discuss the benefits and challenges of using Microsoft Fabric for this project.
5. How would you ensure data security and proper authentication in this setup?

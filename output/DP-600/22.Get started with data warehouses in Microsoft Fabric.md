# Complex Problem

**Problem:**  
Your organization is planning to implement a data warehouse using Microsoft Fabric. The goal is to integrate data from multiple departments, including sales, marketing, and finance, to provide a unified view for analysis and reporting. The data warehouse should support both real-time and historical data analysis.

**Discussion Points:**

1. How would you design the schema for this data warehouse? Consider the use of star or snowflake schemas and justify your choice.
2. What strategies would you employ to ensure data quality and consistency across different departments?
3. How would you handle slowly changing dimensions, such as changes in customer addresses or product prices?
4. Discuss the security measures you would implement to protect sensitive financial data.
5. How would you facilitate collaboration between data engineers, analysts, and data scientists in this project?

Encourage the group to brainstorm and discuss these points, considering the features and capabilities of Microsoft Fabric.

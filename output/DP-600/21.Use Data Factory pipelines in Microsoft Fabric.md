# Complex Problem

**Problem:**  
Imagine you are tasked with designing a data pipeline in Microsoft Fabric to automate the ingestion and transformation of sales data from multiple sources into a centralized data warehouse. The data needs to be cleaned, transformed, and aggregated before loading. Discuss the following:

- Which activities would you include in your pipeline, and why?
- How would you use parameters to enhance the pipeline's flexibility?
- What challenges might you face in orchestrating the data flow, and how would you address them?

Encourage group discussions to explore different approaches and solutions.

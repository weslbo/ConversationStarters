# Complex Problem

**Problem:**  
Your organization is planning to implement a medallion architecture in Fabric to manage its data lakehouse. The data team is tasked with designing a solution that accommodates multiple departments, each with unique data needs. The finance department requires daily aggregated financial reports, while the sales department needs real-time sales data analysis. Additionally, the data science team needs access to enriched datasets for machine learning models.

**Discussion Points:**

- How would you design the medallion architecture to meet the needs of these departments?
- What specific transformations and tools would you use at each layer?
- How would you ensure data security and governance across different layers?
- Discuss the role of CI/CD in maintaining the gold layer for each department.
- How would you handle data orchestration to ensure timely data availability for each department?

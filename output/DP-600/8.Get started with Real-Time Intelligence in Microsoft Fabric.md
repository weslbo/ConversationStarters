# Complex Problem

**Scenario:**  
Imagine you are a data analyst at a manufacturing company using Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence to monitor production lines. You need to set up a system that ingests data from IoT sensors, analyzes it in real-time, and visualizes the results on a dashboard. Additionally, you want to set alerts for any anomalies in temperature readings that exceed a certain threshold.

**Discussion Points:**

1. How would you configure the Real-Time Hub to manage the flow of IoT sensor data?
2. What KQL queries would you write to analyze temperature data and detect anomalies?
3. How would you design the Real-Time Dashboard to effectively visualize the data?
4. What steps would you take to set up alerts for temperature anomalies?
5. How can Copilot assist in creating queries and dashboards for this scenario?

Encourage group discussions to explore different approaches and solutions to this problem.

# Practice Assessment

1. **Multiple Choice:**  
   What is the primary purpose of row-level security (RLS) in Power BI?
   - A) To enhance visual aesthetics
   - B) To restrict access to specific data rows
   - C) To improve data processing speed
   - D) To create new data tables  
   **Answer:** B) To restrict access to specific data rows

2. **True/False:**  
   Static rules in RLS require frequent updates when new data is added.  
   - True
   - False  
   **Answer:** True

3. **Fill-in-the-Blanks:**  
   Dynamic rules in RLS use DAX functions like _______ and _______ to return environmental values.  
   - Suggestions: USERNAME, USERPRINCIPALNAME, CUSTOMDATA  
   **Answer:** USERNAME, USERPRINCIPALNAME

4. **Multiple Choice:**  
   Which tool is NOT typically used to manage roles in Power BI?
   - A) Power BI Desktop
   - B) SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
   - C) Microsoft Word
   - D) Tabular Editor  
   **Answer:** C) Microsoft Word

5. **True/False:**  
   Object-level security (OLS) can secure both tables and columns in Power BI.  
   - True
   - False  
   **Answer:** True

6. **Fill-in-the-Blanks:**  
   In Power BI, _______ allows users to see reports with different roles enforced.  
   - Suggestions: View as, Edit mode, Design view  
   **Answer:** View as

7. **Multiple Choice:**  
   What is a potential disadvantage of using static rules in RLS?
   - A) They are too dynamic
   - B) They require constant updates
   - C) They are too complex to set up
   - D) They do not restrict data access  
   **Answer:** B) They require constant updates

8. **True/False:**  
   Perspectives in Power BI can be used as a security feature to restrict data access.  
   - True
   - False  
   **Answer:** False

9. **Fill-in-the-Blanks:**  
   To set up OLS, you need to use an _______ endpoint in Power BI Premium.  
   - Suggestions: XMLA, API, SQL  
   **Answer:** XMLA

10. **Multiple Choice:**  
    Which of the following is a good practice for enforcing data permissions in Power BI?
    - A) Use static rules exclusively
    - B) Filter fact tables instead of dimension tables
    - C) Validate roles rigorously
    - D) Create as many roles as possible  
    **Answer:** C) Validate roles rigorously

# Complex Problem

**Scenario:**  
Adventure Works wants to implement a security model for their Power BI reports that ensures salespeople can only view sales data relevant to their assigned regions. The company has six regions, and salespeople may be reassigned to different regions over time. Additionally, sensitive employee data, such as salaries, must be restricted to HR personnel only.

**Task:**  
Design a comprehensive security strategy using RLS and OLS for Adventure Works. Consider both static and dynamic rules, and outline how you would implement role mappings and validate the security setup. Discuss potential challenges and how you would address them.

**Discussion Points:**
- How to efficiently manage role assignments and updates.
- The balance between static and dynamic rules.
- Ensuring sensitive data is protected while maintaining usability.
- Strategies for testing and validating the security model.

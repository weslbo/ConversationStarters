### Complex Problem

**Problem:**  
Imagine a small coastal town is planning to transition to 100% renewable energy within the next decade. The town has access to abundant sunlight, strong coastal winds, and a nearby river. However, the local ecosystem is sensitive, and the community is concerned about potential environmental impacts. 

Discuss and propose a comprehensive plan that balances the use of solar, wind, and hydropower while minimizing ecological disruption. Consider factors such as energy storage, grid integration, and community involvement in your solution.

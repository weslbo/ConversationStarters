# Complex Problem

**Scenario:**  
You are part of a team managing a data warehouse for a multinational retail company. The warehouse contains sensitive customer information, sales data, and supplier details. Your task is to design a security strategy that ensures:

- Only authorized personnel can access customer data.
- Sales data is accessible only to regional managers for their respective regions.
- Supplier details are restricted to procurement officers.

**Discussion Points:**

1. How would you implement Dynamic Data Masking to protect customer information?
2. What Row-Level Security policies would you apply to ensure regional managers only see their region's sales data?
3. How would you use Column-Level Security to restrict access to supplier details?
4. Discuss the role of workspace roles and item permissions in your security strategy.
5. How can the principle of least privilege be applied to ensure minimal access rights are granted?

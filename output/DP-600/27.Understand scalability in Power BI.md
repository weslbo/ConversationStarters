# Complex Problem

**Scenario:**  
Your organization is planning to deploy a Power BI solution to handle a dataset that is expected to grow from millions to billions of rows over the next few years. The dataset will be used for real-time reporting and analytics. You have access to Power BI Premium.

**Task:**  
Discuss and outline a strategy to design a scalable data model that can handle this growth. Consider the following aspects:

- Choice of data model framework (Import, DirectQuery, Composite)
- Data transformation and preparation strategies
- Use of Power BI Premium features
- Best practices for maintaining performance and manageability

Encourage group discussions to explore different approaches and justify the choices made.
